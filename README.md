# Cirno Discord Bot
Hi, if you are reading this you may have known about Cirno - a character from the Touhou game. The plushie version itself - "Fumo" is well-known in the Vietnamese meme community between 2020 and 2022 because of its silliness. I, as a middle-schooler enjoyed watching Touhou memes and at that time, I found out that Discord music bots were being suspended by the Discord staff. As a Discord enthusiast for the time being, I came up with the idea of making a Cirno Fumo-related bot which can play music. 

That project was my best ambition to learn programming in the given time, despite being a dumbhead at the developing field. Fully written in Python, used MongoDB as main database system, based on discord.py, with some (a lot) lines of code copied from the internet, though the codes are kinda scrambled and painful to read, I proudly say that this is the one of the best pet project I've ever done.

However, nowadays, with the shutdown of various free hosting servers, along with programming libraries being updated frequently and hard to keep up with, I found out that I cannot maintain this project anymore. With that given, I had no choice but to terminate Cirno bot project and publish its source code to Github ~~(to showoff)~~

# Usage
If you know have base knowledge in Python and MongoDB, you should understand codes in this project since the 13-year-old me cannot handle such complex algorithms. Some libraries should be updated such as [WaveLink](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink), [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). 

This project runs at `Python 3.x`.
